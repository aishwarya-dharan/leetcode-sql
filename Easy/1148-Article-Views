The distinct keyword tells MySQL to find the unique occurances we are lookingfor
This erases the duplicates
The as keyword renames what we want kind of like in Python

SELECT DISTINCT author_id AS id
FROM
    Views
WHERE
    author_id = viewer_id
# Order by tells us what we want to sort the data by
ORDER BY id
