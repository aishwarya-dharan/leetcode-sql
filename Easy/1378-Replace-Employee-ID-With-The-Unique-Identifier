By using left join we can fetch ids which don't have unique ids as well
and if we try to use right join we are only fetching unique ids but still not unique id remains.

SELECT unique_id, name
FROM Employees
LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI
ON Employees.id = EmployeeUNI.id;

Alice and Bob do not have a unique ID, We will show null instead.
The unique ID of Meir is 2.
The unique ID of Winston is 3.
The unique ID of Jonathan is 1.
