By doing a self-join on the Weather table, we create a Cartesian product of the table with itself, creating pairs of days.
The inner query is responsible for retrieving the temperature of the day before the date currently under consideration in the outer query.

It utilizes the DATE_ADD function to find the date one day before the recordDate in the outer query (w1.recordDate)
and then fetches the temperature recorded on that previous date from the same Weather table (alias w2).

Lastly, we filter these pairs of consecutive days further to only include pairs where the temperature is higher on the second day.
The resulting ids represent the days where the temperature was higher than the previous day.

SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather w1
JOIN Weather w2
ON w1.recordDate = DATE_ADD(w2.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
WHERE w1.temperature > w2.temperature;
