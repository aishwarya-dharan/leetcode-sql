-- Problem: 003. Big Countries
-- Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/big-countries/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50
-- Difficulty: Easy
--
-- Problem summary:
-- Given a table `world(name, continent, area, population, gdp)`,
-- return the names of countries with population > 25,000,000 OR area > 3,000,000.
-- The result should be ordered by population in descending order (largest population first).
--
-- Notes:
-- - This solution assumes `population` and `area` are numeric.
-- - If population is NULL for some rows, they are treated as NULL (not excluded by this query unless explicitly filtered).
-- - LeetCode test cases treat the schema consistently; this is the canonical simple solution.

SELECT name, population, area
FROM world
WHERE population >= 25000000 OR area >= 3000000;
