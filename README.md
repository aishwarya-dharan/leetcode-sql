# leetcode-sql
Welcome to my repository of **LeetCode SQL + Data Analytics** coding solutions.

I’m documenting my learning journey as I transition to Data Analytics. 

**Each problem includes:**
​ 
 1. Problem statement (with link)
 
 2. SQL/Python solution
 
 3. Explanation of approach
 
 4. Complexity analysis (if relevant)

  **Easy** - Beginner-friendly problems
  
  **Medium** - More complex queries with joins, subqueries, aggregations
  
  **Hard** - Advanced optimization, window functions, analytics challenges

# Problem Index
**Easy**
1. Title Solution Explanation
2. 1757 Recyclable and Low Fat Products SQL Simple WHERE clause filtering
   
**Medium**
1. Title Solution Explanation
2. 183 Customers Who Never Order SQL Demonstrates LEFT JOIN + filtering
   
**Hard**
1. Title Solution Explanation

# Tools & Tech
1. SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
2. Python (Pandas, NumPy for analytics)
3. Jupyter Notebooks (for hybrid data projects)
4. Power BI / Tableau (for visualization projects)

# Goals of This Repo
1. Build a solid foundation in SQL & analytics problem-solving
2. Showcase real-world data projects & dashboards
3. Transition into Data Analytics → Analytics Engineering career path

# How to Use This Repo
# Clone it:
1. git clone https://github.com/your-username/leetcode-sql-solutions.git
2. Navigate to the folder for difficulty level.
3. Run the .sql file in MySQL/PostgreSQL to test.

# Next Steps
1. Add 20+ SQL problems (Easy → Hard)
2. Document approaches clearly
3. Expand repo with Python data analysis challenges
4. Add Power BI/Tableau dashboards from real datasets

This repo will evolve into my Data Analytics portfolio, combining:
1. LeetCode SQL problems
2. Data cleaning/analysis in Python
3. Interactive dashboards
